      <p>Anvil Hack - the student-run hackathon at Goldsmiths, Unviersity of London - is back for the third year! Our hackathon is focussed on the creative applications of technology taking place at a centre of creative computing research.</p>
      <p>Use your skills to make something wonderful, arty, musical - anything you build will be awesome. We'll provide you with food, drink, electricity and internet, so that you can get on with the real work - making cool things!</p>
      <p>This year we have the privilege of sharing our brand new fabrication lab with you, built right into the church. You'll have access to state of the art equipment just a couple of months after it's been installed. Exciting!</p>

        <h1>Frequently asked questions</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h2>What is Anvil Hack?</h2>
            <p>Anvil Hack is a two-day invention marathon for developers, designers, psychologists, researchers and more. During the event, participants will build projects that answer our challenges to build awesome creative projects.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>But what are you expecting to actually be built?</h2>
            <p>Anything goes! We're really interested to see what awesome things you can build, especially interesting generative art, awesome audio projects, and DIY hardware.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>How much does this event cost to attend?</h2>
            <p>We want to make this event accessible for everyone, so there is no charge to enter. If you are interested in supporting this event as a sponsor, please <a href="mailto:klewi014@gold.ac.uk">get in touch</a>.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Do I need to be a student to attend?</h2>
            <p>Yes, you need to be a current student or have graduated within the last 12 months. We will work to ensure that there is a diverse range of people in terms of skill set and ability.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Do I need to attend with a team?</h2>
            <p>You don’t need a team to take part; it’s perfectly acceptable to create a solo project. However, during the event itself, there will be opportunities to share ideas and connect with your fellow hackers to form a team. As organisers, we’ll do our best to encourage and facilitate teamwork across the weekend.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Can I start before?</h2>
            <p>While you can explore ideas before the Anvil Hack III weekend and produce designs, you cannot write a line of code for your project before the event itself and still enter the challenges. If you want to bring an existing project to the table, we encourage full disclosure and honesty.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Do I have to stay overnight?</h2>
            <p>No, it is not a requisite to stay over. If you would like to stay though, we'll have a small number of airbeds available. We recommend you bring sleeping bags, pillows, and a change of clothes. There is also a shower - bring a towel if you want to use it.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>What's the deal with food?</h2>
            <p>All food across the weekend will be provided. That is: lunch and dinner on Saturday, breakfast and lunch on Sunday. All dietary requirements will be considered and catered for - please make sure you provide this information upon registering.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Who owns the projects?</h2>
            <p>All IP generated at Anvil Hack III belongs to the teams. However, to generate the widest benefit from this event, we encourage attendees to provide Open Source licenses for the results of their work.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Can I attend if I'm under 18?</h2>
            <p>Currently not. We're working on potentially making this event accessible to those under the age of 18, but for the moment we ae not able to accommodate them.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>What shall I bring?</h2>
            <p>All participants will need to bring their laptop, charger(s) and any other devices they wish to work on. If you are staying overnight, you will also need to bring a sleeping bag.</p>
          </li>
